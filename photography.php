            <h2>Through my Lens</h2>
            <p>These were taken throughout the past five years with a Nikon D5500 camera and a 18-55mm lens. 
            I mainly take photos of nature, scenery, and still life objects. In the future, I think it would be nice
            and challenging to try myself at some portrait photography. As well, these photos are a combination of 
            raw photos (not edited in anyway) and edited photos. The various softwares I used include Adobe Photoshop, 
            Adobe Lightroom, Apple Photos, and VSCO.</p>
