            <p>These painting pieces were created in the fall of 2022 at the University of Vermont for the class: Painting: Color and Invention. 
                The main focus of this course was to study how color can be created and used to produce different outcomes. 
                We learned the four main Renaissance techniques: up-modeling, down-modeling, unione, and cangiante. 
                All of these paintings used acrylic paintings: primary cyan, primary magenta, and primary yellow. 
                The goal of this class was to use the three colors to create the palettes we wanted to use for each piece. </p>
