                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <p>Volunteering your time to help at shelters and important causes is a great and direct way of reaching out to help those that might need help.</p>

                <p>Some of the places that you can volunteer at are:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Organizations</th>    <th>Shelters</th>
                        <th>Local Centers</th>
                    </tr>
                    
                    <tr>
                        <td>Disaster Relief</td>
                        <td>Homeless</td>
                        <td>Parks & Recreation</td>
                    </tr>

                <h2>Donating</h2>
                <p>Another way to help others is to donate. Donating money is not the only way for one to do this. Donating old or not-used anymore items is a great way to give to others. These could include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clothes</li>
                    <li>Books</li>
                    <li>Toys</li>
                    <li>Source: <cite>Pearl Sutton</cite></li>

                </ul>
                <p>Donating fresh or canned food is another way for people to donate.</p>
