        <h2>Side Notes</h2>
            <p>The three digital pieces presenting the Starry Nights Bookshop business was a midterm project I did in my freshman year. The goal of the assignment was to design a business that you would enjoy running, and desgin its brand. I chose to do a bookshop and called it the Starry Nights Bookshop. The first two pieces were desgins for a business card, and the other was a flyer for the shop. Looking back at them, I feel I could improve the composition and desgin of the business card to either match the flyer more or look more professional. </p>
            <p>As well, the final piece of the girl is a raster graphic of Jess Conte, a video creator, whom I used to watch a lot at the time. </p>
